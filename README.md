# Teach AI To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

This is a RL project based on Snake!

For a quick run just run:
    python3 agent.py
and see the base DQN algorithm training process.

Project Strucrure:

SNAKE: <br>
    Environment:
        game.py
    Model:
        model.py
        ddqn_model.py
    Agent:
        agent.py
        ddqn_agent.py (actually also training process handlers)
    Helper and data management:
        plotCSV.py
        helper.py
